# ðŸš½ Webpee 

A lightweight Node JS cli tool written in Typescript to convert images into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">WebP</a> format.
Sizes and quality are configurable.

Resizing is done with <a href="https://github.com/lovell/sharp">Sharp</a> which is typically 4x-5x faster ðŸ’¨ than using the quickest ImageMagick 
and GraphicsMagick.

## ðŸ“ƒ Documentation

Clone or download the repo and run the following commands in the root directory of the project.
1. `npm install`
2. `tsc`
3. `npm start`

When using default WebpeeConfig all folders are created by default. Just pass in the image you want to convert into ./images folder. ðŸš½ will do the rest.

I'm using <a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar">Chokidar</a>ðŸ‘€ to listen for new images. All file extensions except 
* **png**
* **svg**
* **jpg**
* **svg**
* **gif**
* **tiff** 
are ignored by Chokidar ðŸ‘€.

Basic logging is realized with <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">Winston</a>. A combinded log file and separated error log is created by default under ./logs. ðŸš‚
